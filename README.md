#Fieldsurf - a surveytool for Plant and animal recording
Fieldsurf is a tryout for using kivy to write a tool to survey species in the field. 
The app can record Species and has a sophisticated autosuggestion which makes species recording efficient. 
However, especially the map handling is dificult why I continued writing the app in Kotlin.
